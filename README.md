# analyzing_aimd_simulations
Collection of codes to analyze periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These codes are under continuous development, and more features will be incorporated soon.

# bond length
bond_angle.ipynb tracks the bond distance between any two atoms during a periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. The input to the code is the *XDATCAR.xlsx file, which is a slightly formatted version of the XDATCAR file generated by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.

# bond angle
bond_angle.ipynb tracks the bond angle between any three atoms during a periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. The input to the code is the *XDATCAR.xlsx file, which is a slightly formatted version of the XDATCAR file generated by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.

# radial distribution function
radial_distribution_function.ipynb generates the probability and radial distribution functions for a reference atom for a periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. The code can be manipulated to give instantaneous and average distribution functions. The input to the code is the *XDATCAR.xlsx file, which is a slightly formatted version of the XDATCAR file generated by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.
